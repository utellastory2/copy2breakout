=============

breakout with weird bug

sometimes the ball just passes thru the bricks then again sometimes it removes them just like it is suppose too.

2nd BUG: once a break in the red bricks occurs and the ball bounces off the top of the window the ball removes all 
all the breaks in its path on its way back down to the paddle.

3rd BUG: sometimes the ball hugs the bottom of the paddle until it gets the edge of the paddle and then goes up
again toward the bricks
